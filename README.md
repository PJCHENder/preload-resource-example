# Playground with Browser Sync

This is a simple local server with browser-sync feature (but no compilation of sass).

## Usage

```bash
npm install
npm run start
```

## Config

In default, it will set the port to '7777', and the browser will be 'Firefox Developer Edition'.

You can modify the default in `package.json`
